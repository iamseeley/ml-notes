## key machine learning terms and their definitions

### ml related fields
- **ai**: refers to computer systems performing human-like tasks that normally require human intelligence.

- **ml**:  a subset of ai, ml focuses on building computer systems that learn a pattern from the input data.

- **deep learning**: a subset of ml and a ml technique that is based on multi-layer neural networks that learn from large amounts of data.

- **data science**: the application of various analysis and statistical techniques to gain insights into large collections of data.

- **data mining**: process of extracting usable data from a large dataset by analyzing data patterns, correlations, and anomalies to predict outcomes. 

### ml broad categories
- **supervised learning**: ml algorithm which uses labeled datasets to train the algorithm. Input is mapped to desired output based on the labeled, predefined input-output examples. 

- **semi-supervised learning**: ml algorithm that trains on both labeled and unlabelled input data to determine the correct label or mapping for input data.

-**unsupervised-learning**: ml algorithm that trains on unlabelled data to discover patterns, associations, and clusters within the data to help solve problems and gain insight into the data.

- **reinforcement-learning**: ml algorithm that trains the algorithm by using feedback in the form of rewards and punishments, positive and negative behavior, to find a suitable action model--the one that achieves maximum reward--to solve a problem. 

### ml techniques
- **inference**: process of using a trained ml model to make a prediction on input data.

- **classification**: a model identifies a class or category label for given input data.

- **regression**: the model is trained to understand the relationship between independent variables and a dependent variable to predict or forecast an outcome.

- **prediction**: the predicted, or likely, outcome from new input data fed into an ai or ml algorithm after it has been trained.

### ml data
- **data**: information in the form of text, images, audio clips, etc. that can be processed by a computer.

- **datasets**: a set or collection of data.

- **data collection**: refers to collecting or assembling of data into a dataset.

- **data cleaning**: the process of finding and fixing or removing incorrect data, corrupted data, or duplicate data from a dataset.

- **data curation**: the work of collecting, cleaning, organizing, and managing data and datasets from one or more sources.

### ml data splits
- **input data**: data that is fed into the ml or ai algorithm.

- **training data**: input data that is used to train the model. It is the information ml algorithms use to create models that can be used and evaluated.

- **test data**: input data that is used to assess the final model for accuracy and performance.

- **validation data**: input data used to optimize the ml model parameters.
