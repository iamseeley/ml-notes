## what's the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning?

artificial intelligence (ai) is a broad field that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. machine learning (ml) is a subset of ai that specifically deals with the creation of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. In other words, AI is the overall concept, while ML is a specific approach within AI that allows systems to learn from data.


"ai is magic"

ai and ml are not magic. they are based on mathematical algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks. these systems are designed and trained by human developers and data scientists, and their capabilities are derived from the data they are trained on and the algorithms they employ.
