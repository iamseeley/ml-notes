## inputs

### features
- the individual measurable properties or characteristics of the observed data used as inputs to the ml model

- the variables that the model uses to learn patterns and relationships in the data and make predictions or decisions

- features can be numerical (e.g., age, temperature), categorical (e.g., color, gender), or derived from raw data (e.g., text embeddings, image descriptors)

### predictors
- similar to features, predictors are the variables used to predict the target or dependent variable in a ml model

- in the context of supervised learning, predictors are the input variables that are used to predict the output or target variable

- the term "predictor" emphasizes the variable's role in making predictions, whereas "feature" is a more general term

### attributes
- another term for features or predictors, often used in the context of data representation or data instances

- each instance or data point in a dataset in a dataset is characterized by a set of attributes that describe its properties or characteristics

- attributes can be seen as the columns or fields in a structured dataset, representing the different variables or dimensions of the data

### independent variables
- refers to the variables that are manipulated or changed to observe their effect on the dependent variable

- in ml, independent variables are the input features or predictors used to model and predict the dependent variable or target

- the term emphasizes the assumed causal relationship between the input variables and the output variable, although this relationship may not always be causal in nature


**These terms are often used interchangeably in different contexts, but they all refer to the input variables used in machine learning models to learn patterns, make predictions, or discover relationships in the data.**
