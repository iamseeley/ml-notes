## machine learning paradigm and workflow

### three steps
- define the task
- develop a model 
- deploy the model

### define the task
- frame the problem
- collect a dataset
- understand the data
- choose a measure of success

### develop a model
- prepare the data
- choose your machine
- choose an evaluation protocol
- beat a baseline

### explaining results
- baseline vs results
- methods and computational requirements
- provide an overview of realistic expectations of a deployed inference model
- a basic plan for monitoring and maintaining your model
