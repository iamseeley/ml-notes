## outputs

### predictions 
- the outputs generated by a ml model when given new, unseen input data

- they represent the model's best guess or estimate of the target variable based on the patterns and relationships it learned during training

- predictions can be continuous values in regression problems or discrete values in classification problems

### classes
- refer to the discrete categories or labels that a machine learning model predicts in a classification problem

- the goal of a classification model is to assign input instances to one of the predefined classes based on the learned patterns and decision boundaries

- examples of classes include binary categories or multi-class categories

### responses
- similar to predictions, responses are the outputs generated by a ml model in response to input data

- the term is often used in the context of models that generate text, such as language models, where the model generates a response based on the input prompt or query

- responses can also refer to the actual or observed values of the target variable in a supervised learning problem, which the model aims to predict accurately

### dependent variables 
- refer to the variables that are influenced or determined by the independent variables

- in ml, the dependent variable is the target variable or the output that the model aims to predict based on the input features or independent variables

- the term emphasizes the assumed causal relationship between the input variables and the output variable, where changes in the independent variables are expected to affect the dependent variable

**These terms are used to describe the output or the result of a machine learning model, whether it's a prediction, a class label, a generated response, or the actual value of the target variable. The choice of the term often depends on the specific problem domain, the type of model, and the context in which the results are being discussed.**
