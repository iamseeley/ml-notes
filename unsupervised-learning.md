## unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data, meaning that the input data does not have corresponding output labels or target values. 

In this approach, the model aims to discover hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without being explicitly guided or supervised. 

The goal is for the model to identify inherent groupings, associations, or representations in the data that can provide insights or be used for further analysis. 

Common examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, where the model groups similar data points together based on their intrinsic characteristics, and dimensionality reduction, where the model learns to represent high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space while preserving its essential structure. 

Unsupervised learning is often used for exploratory data analysis, anomaly detection, or as a preprocessing step for supervised learning tasks.
