## data quality, management, and curation and its implications on machine learning

### data quality
- data quality refers to the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability of the data used to train ml models.

- poor data quality can lead to biased, inaccurate, or unreliable ml models, as the algorithms learn from an perpetuate the erros, inconsistencies, or gaps in the data.

- ensuring high data quality involves processes such as data validation, cleaning, and preprocessing to identify and address issues like missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.

### data management
- data management involves the processes and practices used to collect, store, organize, and maintain data throughout its lifecycle.

- effective data management ensures that the data is accessible, secure, and properly formatted for analysis and model training.

- this includes tasks such as data integration, data versioning, metadata management, and access control to facilitate efficient and responsible use of data assets.

### data curation
- data curation is the process of selecting, organizing, and maintaining data to ensure its quality, relevance, and value for specific purposes, such as machine learning.

- curating data for ml involves tasks such as data exploration, data sampling, feature selection, and data labeling to create high-quality, representative datasets for model training and evaluation.

- proper data curation helps address issues like data bias, class imbalance, and data drift, which can significantly impact the performance and fairness (algorithmic bias) of ml models.
