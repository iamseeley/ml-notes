## supervised learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data, meaning that the input data is accompanied by the correct output or target values. 

In this approach, the model is trained on a dataset containing pairs of input features and their corresponding output labels, allowing it to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs. 
The goal is for the model to generalize from the training examples and accurately predict the output labels for new, unseen input data. 

Common examples of supervised learning include image classification, where the model learns to assign labels to images based on their content, and sentiment analysis, where the model learns to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral based on the provided examples.
